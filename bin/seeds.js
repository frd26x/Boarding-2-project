    description: 'Pictionary is a charades-inspired word-guessing game invented by Robert Angel. The game consists in Each team moves a piece on a game board formed by a sequence of squares. Each square has a letter or shape identifying the type of picture to be drawn on it. The objective is to be the first team to reach the last space on the board. To achieve this a player must guess the word or phrase being drawn by their partner, or if the player lands on an "all play" square, one player from each team attempts to illustrate the same concept simultaneously, with the two teams racing to guess first. The first player to land and guess correctly at the finish wins.'

    description: 'Each player starts the game with six random cards. Players then take turns being the storyteller. The player whose turn it is to be storyteller looks at the six images in his or her hand. From one of these, he or she makes up a sentence or phrase that might describe it and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players). Each other player then selects from among their own six cards the one that best matches the sentence given by the storyteller. Then, each player gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others. The storyteller shuffles his or her chosen card with the cards received from the other players, and all cards are then dealt face up. The players (except for the storyteller) then secretly guess which picture was the storyteller\'s, using numbered voting chips.'

    description: 'The game is played by two to four players on a square board with a 15Ã—15 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile. In official club and tournament games, play is between two players or, occasionally, between two teams each of which collaborates on a single rack. The board is marked with \"premium\" squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red \"triple-word\" squares, 17 pale red \"double-word\" squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol; 12 dark blue \"triple-letter\" squares, and 24 pale blue \"double-letter\" squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL, but the original premium square color scheme is still preferred for Scrabble boards used in tournaments'
